1. My knowledge of the tech field has changed greatly. I did not know it was filled with so many languages and parts. With how vast each language is and how there are so many ways to do everything was really an eyeopener.
The most difficult part of foundations was digesting all the information and understanding it. With topics like SQL I did have trouble understanding what we were doing and I had to just take it slow.
I learned that I work better alone when it comes to getting a basic understanding of a topic. I like working at my own pace and coming back to my work to get a clear view of what I am doing. With pairs I did feel rushed sometimes if I did not know something and my partner did. Teaching what I knew was a good way to make sure I knew a topic well helped as well, but in most cases I did not know it well enough.
I will apply what I learned in specialization by keeping a consistent schedule and ensuring I spend my days learning and relearning topics throughout taking short breaks in between. Overall consistent and persistence was something I need to maintain for specialization and my career overall.
Pair programming was okay if I knew the assignment and my partner did not. Other times I felt nervous and did my best to keep up but did not learn as much as I should of. I did spark up great conversation with my partners after we finished and they were always great people. 
The skills assessments were my favorite part, they wwere good review of the topics throughout the week. Eric was also a bright spot, his teaching style and attitude were splendid and Ill miss it.
